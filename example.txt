	That Time I Tried Skateboarding

	oNce upon a time, I was at a sleepover at mfriend's plce. We were evil kdsi asnd we made some prank calls andafterwards, my friend uggested I learn to skateboard. I was a little reluctant, but at 2 a.m., I didn't have the wisdom to jsut say no.

	Things began all right: I could balance quite welll when standing on the board as it rested on the grass. 

	And I could even balance a little on the board when it was rougly stationary on the sidewalk. Naturlly, the next thing to try was a little skateboarding from the sidewalk onto the road.

	Gracefully, I pushed myself and the skateboard forward, toawrds the road. Unbeknownst to me, however, was the fact that the curb was very, very steep: there was no gentle gradient but an abrupt drop of about a foot. And so, I lost my balance and fell offf the board. The board glided smothley into the street and I, instinctively, flailed my arms backwards as I fell and managed to land perfectly on my left middle finger. Ouch!

	I told my frined that my finger really hurt and he said, that it would be better in the morning. I agreed.

	We went back in the house and eventually slept. It wasn't until the next day, after my parents picked me up, when my finger was aabsolutely throbbing that I suggested the possibility that my finger was broken.

	A few hours later, after some x-rays, indeed my middle finger was broken. So I had to wear this claw-like cast on my hand fr about a month. And that was the first and last time I tried to skatboard.
